# Welcome to Tompkins Square Legacy Food Distribution!
Hello! We are a spin off group of a Manhattan contingent of Food Not Bombs that is run out of the Lower East Side. Lower East Side Food Not Bombs operates once weekly on Sundays, with consensus based decision making for all participants. We cook and serve vegan meals free of charge in the historic Tompkins Square Park. As a satellite group, our mission is to use the same methodology and ethos of the original contingent to extend the service of nutritious vegan meals during the coronavirus outbreak. Seeing as many people have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and government response has been haphazard, we are hoping to feed a greater number of people. We are planning to cook and serve meals in takeout containers to ensure that people have access to healthy meals.
